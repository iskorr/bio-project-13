In order to fetch a project, follow these steps (input into terminal from your workspace):

	mkdir bio-project-13
	cd bio-project-13
	git remote add origin git@github.com:iskorr/bio-project-13.git
	git pull -u origin master

This is it - you have the latest version of the repository. To commit input:

	git add <filename> // or alternatively 'git add .'
	git commit -m "Your description goes here"
	git push	// sometimes (in case of conflicts, you'll need to pull before pushing)
